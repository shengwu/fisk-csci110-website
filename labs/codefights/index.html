      <h1>Lab 7: CodeFights</h1>

      <p>CodeFights is one of my favorite websites to practice programming. You can do daily challenges, compete in tournaments against other players, challenge individuals to 1v1 matches, do time trials against engineers at specific companies, and more.</p>

      <p>Here's an example of a problem that involves bit shifting. The problem is described on the left. Write your answer in the code pane in the upper right, then click Run Tests to test your code. In this screenshot, I've put in a wrong answer so the tests failed. You get a chance to look at each failing test in the bottom right:</p>

      <div><img src="ss2.png" alt="" width="700"></div>

      <p>After writing a correct answer and verifying it with the visible test cases, you can click Submit to test it on the complete test case set. With any luck, your code will pass all of the tests:</p>

      <h2>Your assignment</h2>


      <p>Work with a partner to solve all eight challenges in the Code Arcade's Intro Gates. Each person should create his or her own CodeFights account, solve all eight problems, and submit his or her own code to Canvas by copying and pasting it into the text box in Canvas. Work only with your partner.</p>

      <p>This is what it looks like after you finish the Intro Gates:</p>
