      <h1>Lab 12: Command line</h1>
      <p>The Unix command line has a bunch of incredibly powerful utilities. The philosophy is having individual tools that are very good at their jobs. One example: with <code>dig</code>, you can <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2829/query-wikipedia-via-console-over-dns#comment">query Wikipedia from your command line</a>.</p>
      <p>However, much of the power comes from pipes. A pipe (|) takes the output from one command and uses it as input to the next. Here's a ridiculous example that <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/350/output-your-microphone-to-a-remote-computers-speaker#comment">outputs your computer's microphone to another computer's speaker</a>.

      <p>NOTE: the Windows "Command Prompt" behaves differently than the command lines on Linux and Mac computers. Many of the principles are the same, but for this lab, please use <strong>Cygwin</strong> on the lab computers, or Terminal/iTerm on a personal Mac or Linux computer.</p>

      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>First, do the Codeacademy command line tutorial for 25-30 mins to familiarize yourself with the command line:</p>
